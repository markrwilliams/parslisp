# parslisp
_A Lisp that's mostly Parsley_

[OMeta](http://www.tinlizzie.org/ometa/) extends [Parsing Expression Grammars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) to match arbitrary data types.  But what does that mean?

`Parslisp` is a simple Lisp interpreter that's intended to demonstrate OMeta's tree-transformation abilities.  Since it's written in Python it uses [parsley](https://github.com/python-parsley/parsley).
